// FaceMesh:
// This class derives from MeshObject and creates a ID3D11Buffer of
// vertices and indices to represent a canonical face defined as a
// rectangle at the origin extending 1 unit in the +X and
// 1 unit in the +Y direction.
// The face is defined to be two sided, so it is visible from either
// side.
